## What is Brexit?

Brexit is an abbreviation of the phrase "British exit", referring to the recent referendum of Britain's membership of the European Union.

### What is the European Union (EU), and who cares about Brexit?

The EU is an economic and political union between 28 European countries. In 1967, the European Community was established, and in 1973, Great Britain (GB) joined. Later, in November of 1993, the EU was formed. You can read more about the EU and its history [here](http://europa.eu/about-eu/basic-information/about/index_en.htm).

Member countries of the EU have the right to leave  the EU under what is known as [Article 50](http://www.lisbon-treaty.org/wcm/the-lisbon-treaty/treaty-on-European-union-and-comments/title-6-final-provisions/137-article-50.html), which was introduced by the [Treaty of Lisbon](http://www.lisbon-treaty.org/wcm/). Until 23 June, 2016, no member of the EU has ever opted to withdraw.

It would appear that [many](https://www.google.com/webhp?hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj_7ODmt8HNAhVCMBoKHaOQCdIQPAgD#safe=off&hl=en&q=brexit), [many]() ([many!](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Brexit&src=tyah)) people care about Brexit, as it will likely have a great impact on both GB's and the EU's [economies](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/23/world/europe/brexit-consequences.html?_r=0), among [other things](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-impact-factbox-idUSKCN0ZA0LX).

### What happens next?

First and foremost, the EU must revise their [flag](http://www.flags.net/images/largeflags/EUUN0001.GIF) (not really).

Next, GB will follow the brief procedures in Article 50. [Here](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/24/britain-votes-to-leave-the-eu-what-happens-now-that-brexit-is-a/) is a good article explaining what happens next.

### Are there any bright sides?

Well, tuition for English schools becomes much cheaper for international students due to the [lowered exchange rate](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/06/24/the-british-pound-has-suffered-a-stunning-collapse/).
